  <h1> Step 1: Develop Problem Statement </h1>
  
<div class = "bodybox"> 
  <h2> Ideal </h2>
<p> Make data accessible for all personnel within the organization, including those without extensive GIS experience. </p>
 
  <h2> Reality </h2>
  <p> Many people do not have a background in GIS and need user firendly maps to help them understand relevant information from the product. </p>
    
  <h2> Consequences </h2>
  <p> If the map is not user friendly for those without a background in GIS then decision making process can be slowed 
    down and relevant information may be difficult for the user to access and understand. </p>
  
  <h2> Proposal </h2>
  <p> Create an interactive map that can be used to identify potential restoration areas.  Functionality will be added to the map in the form of 
    pop-ups that will display relevant information that can be used to help with decision making processes. </p>
 
  <h2> Technology Used </h2> 
  <p> Leaflet, AGOL and Dashboard </p>
