  <h1> Step 1: Develop Problem Statement </h1>
  
<div class = "bodybox"> 
  <h2> Ideal </h2>
<p> Make data accessible for all personnel within the organization, including those without extensive GIS experience. </p>
 
  <h2> Reality </h2>
  <p> Many people do not have a background in GIS and need user firendly maps to help them understand relevant information from the product. </p>
    
  <h2> Consequences </h2>
  <p> If the map is not user friendly for those without a background in GIS then decision making process can be slowed 
    down and relevant information may be difficult for the user to access and understand. </p>
  
  <h2> Proposal </h2>
  <p> Create an interactive map that can be used to identify potential restoration areas.  Functionality will be added to the map in the form of 
    pop-ups that will display relevant information that can be used to help with decision making processes. </p>
 
  <h2> Technology Used </h2> 
  <p> Leaflet, AGOL and Dashboard </p>

  <h1> Step 2: Create Leaflet Map </h1>
  
  <div class = "bodybox"> 
    <h2> Phase 1 - </h2>
	  <p><b>Problem:</b> The boundaries would dance around the area depending on the zoom or where the cursor was.</p>
	  <p><b>QuickFix:</b> The way the style was inserted in the feature class somehow caused it to malfunction and appeared to be the source of the problem. Changing 
	  it from style { } within the feature class to seperating it out of the featureclass itself but adding it afterwards as <b>"featureclassname.setStyle{"</b> allowed it
	  to stop dancing around the area.</p>
    <div class = "gifBoundaries">

    </div>
	  
    <h2> Phase 2 - Add Raster Tiles </h2>
    <p> Begin with adding the raster tiles downloaded from USGS and publish them to agol from arcGIS Pro </p>
    <p> 1st image is from Landsat 5 July 24, 1984 path 17 and row 29. The 2nd image is from Landsat 8 May 27th,
    2021, path 17 and row 29 aswell. Inserting the tiles into the map requires to use the esri <b>tiled map layer function </b>
	  from leaflet and use the rest services url for the desired tile. </p>
  
   <p><b> Problem:</b> The tile would not appear on the map. </p>
       <div> 
	       <img src= "noTile.jpg" alt = "No Tile on Map" width = "301" height= "270">
       </div>        
    <p><b> QuickFix:</b> It was required to use the leaflet <b>get pane function</b> and setting the z-index so
            it displays above the basemap.</p>
    
    <p><b>	Problem:</b> Now the tile is visible, however zooming in and out would make the tile dissappear completely. </p>
    <p><b>  QuickFix:</b> It was required to set the <b>zoom offset allowance</b> to a larger number (deafult is 0.1) so with trial and error 0.6 was the 
	            proper offset to have the tile to display when zooming in or out. </p>

     <p><b>	Problem:</b> Now the tile would display however, it was hiding the boundaries feature class as it was layered on top of it.</p>
        <div>   
	        <img src= "noBoundaries.jpg" alt = "Properties Not visible on Map" width = "688" height= "533">
       </div> 
     <p><b>	QuickFix: Getting the Boundaries to Display:</b>  
	 <ol>
	   <li> creating a pane with leaflets <b>create pane</b> feature for the boundaries. </li>
 	   <li> Then including a pane section in the created feature layer for boundaries and setting it to it. </li>
	   <li> Using that pane, use the <b>get pane function</b> again and setting the z-index to a higher value than the tile. </li>
	 </ol>
   <div>  
      <img src= "showsBoundaries.jpg" alt = "Properties Not visible on Map" width = "523" height= "485">
   </div> 
    <p> Adding in the 2nd tile and replicating what was done for tile 1 resulted in no issues. </p>

     <p><b> Problem:</b> Creating an <b>opacity slider</b> for the two tiles. </p>
     <p><b> Quick Fix:</b>
     <ol>	
	     <li> Creating a function to update the opacity for just 1 tile is necessary to display the changes over time. </li>
       <li> Turn the desired tile into a variable </li>
	     <li> Use that variable and tie it with the <b>set Opacity</b> within the created function. </li>
	     <li> Have the slider appear on the page with html. </li>
	     <dd> - This is done by using <b>input</b>, setting the id to leaflets built in css library for sliders. </dd>
	     <dd>- Then setting the type of slider to range, the min and max values, the increment you want the slider
	      to move and setting the value to where you want the slider to be when opening the map. </dd>
	     <dd> - Make sure to include  "value" in the parentheses in the function.</dd>
	     <dd>- Then finally referencing the function. </dd>
    </ol>	
    <p>VOILA, the slider for the referenced tile is visible and movable. </p>
